# NetPrinting Identification

## Introduction :
The swiss company Polyright provides centralized identification, access and payment systems via RFID card. Future developments are oriented towards digitizing the RFID card. Users will also be able to use their smartphone. 

This Bachelor thesis aims to develop an existing solution based on RFID authentication by adding Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless communication and a reader communicating with a smartphone. This new identification system will have to be integrated into the platforms Polyright's existing ones. The PoC to be developed will allow a user to identify himself securely on a printer, copier or multifunction device (MFP).

## Objectives :
- Analysis of the existing Polyright identification system and implementation of a test bench for the identification of an MFP.
- Specification of the wireless authentication protocol. Analysis of security aspects (authentication, replay attack, data expiration, etc.).
- Replacing the RFID reader or adding a BLE module. Reader and protocol programming.
- Analysis of existing cross-platform mobile development frameworks (iOS, Android). Development of a smartphone test authentication application, integrated into the Polyright environment.
