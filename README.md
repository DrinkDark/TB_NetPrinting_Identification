# NetPrinting Wireless Identification Bachelor Thesis

## Introduction
The Swiss company Polyright provides centralised identification, access and payment systems using RFID cards. Future developments will focus on the digitalisation of RFID cards. 
Users will be able to use their smartphone instead of a card. In most cases a QR code will be used. Both the smartphone and the device will be connected via a cloud. The presence of the phone would therefore be reported to the device using the latter.

However, this solution is not possible for printers. Each Polyright's customer uses the brand and model of printer he prefers. It would be necessary to adapt the program for each new device model to enable communication with the cloud.

This bachelor thesis aims to develop a new authentication solution:
- Based on a existing RFID identification solution.
- Using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication with a smartphone.

This new authentication system has to be secure to prevent any kind of attack.

## Objectives
1. Analysis of Polyright's existing identitication system and ecosystem.
2. Setting up a test bed to simulate a real situation.
3. Analysis of the security aspects and specification of the authentication protocol.
4. Programming the RFID/BLE reader with the authentication protocol.
5. Analysis of existing cross-platform mobile application frameworks (iOs, An-droid) and development of an authenticated smartphone test application.

## Content
### **1. Documentation**
All the diagrams and the BLE analyse done using a BLE sniffer

### **2. Middleware**
Web service coded in Java using the Spring framework. Communicates with the Print manager serveur via a XML API to retrieve usefull informations. Provides a REST service for the mobile application to get print server data, encrypted and decrypted data and the signed message for the authentication.

### **5. Mobile application**
The test mobile application in React Native. Retrieve the user list from the Middleware using the provided Rest service. Can discover device with the specific service UUID. Connect to them by approching the smartphone and then start the authentication protocol. If succeed, it transmit the sigend message containing the selecteed user ID with the current time and the message expiration time.
